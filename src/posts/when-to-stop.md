title: When to Stop

I might have just discovered how to stop an act. The problem starts with when I create a vague outline.

It's one thing to create an outline. It's another to question each entry of the outline. Yet, most times, it takes action to finetune the outline.

But, then...

Whenever I struggle to complete a section, that's probably my inner self telling me my current action doesn't flow with the previous. Time to rethink.

## The Inspiration

I'm pivoting my newsletter. Not that I've written a single issue though. Let's just say I've gotten a better idea of execution.

So, the __goal of my newsletter__ is to 

* pick a favourite website,
* study what makes its UI tick, 
* put __me__ in the shoes of the creator,
* share the reverse engineering process with my __subscribers__.

The advantage is, __we learn from the best__.

Now, for the first issue, I'm examining Andy Bell's [piccalil.li](piccalil.li). This website has a very good theme for blog posts. My goal is to share how it would've been made.

I believed I nailed it for the colour & typography composition. What is left of my outline is the layout. 

I spent a considerable amount of time going back and forth, trying to fit it in. Something feels off. My body seems to repel.

You see, I'd earlier draft the issue's title - “Warm Blog Post Webpage like Piccalil.li”. With another goal of creating a similar issue on “Cool Blog Post Webpage”.

That seems a good way to niche down and focus. And I believe, that is why I feel different while talking about Layout. 

Because the “Layout” is broadening the scope of the issue. My body figured it out faster than my brain. All I needed to do is slow down and let my brain catch up. 

> That moment of reflection is when to decide, unbiasedly, to continue or to stop.
