title: When to STOP

I might have just discovered how to __stop an act__. The problem starts with when I create a _vague_ outline.

It's one thing to __create__ an outline. It's another to __question__ each entry of the outline. Yet, most times, it takes __action__ to finetune the outline.

But, then...

> Whenever I struggle to complete a section, that's probably my inner self telling me my current action doesn't flow with the previous. Time to rethink.

## The Inspiration

I'm pivoting my newsletter. Not that I've written a single issue though. Let's just say I've gotten a better idea of execution.

So, the __goal of my newsletter__ is to 

* pick a favourite website,
* study what makes its UI tick, 
* put __me__ in the shoes of the creator,
* share the reverse engineering process with my __subscribers__.

The advantage is, __we learn from the best__.

Now, for the first issue, I'm examining Andy Bell's [piccalil.li](piccalil.li). This website has a very good theme for blog posts. My goal is to share how it would've been made.

I believed I nailed it for the colour & typography composition. What is left of my outline is the layout. 

I spent a considerable amount of time going back and forth, trying to fit it in. Something feels off. My body seems to repel.

You see, I'd earlier draft the issue's title - “Warm Blog Post Webpage like Piccalil.li”. With another goal of creating a similar issue on “Cool Blog Post Webpage”.

That seems a good way to __niche down and focus__. And I believe, that is why I feel different while talking about Layout. 

Because the “Layout” is broadening the scope of the issue. My body figured it out faster than my brain. All I needed to do is slow down and let my brain catch up. 

> That moment of reflection is when to decide, unbiasedly, to continue or to stop.
