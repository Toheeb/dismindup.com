# Who is Me?

I just wrote an about-me that me loves.

One of my biggest challenges is figuring where I belong. Or, better still, where I want to belong. And, how to tell the world where I belonged.

I love UI design, especially when it comes to Typography. I still have my struggles but I love the fact that they don't scare me.

I'm amazed at HTML. And the challenges of accessibility. Designing for everyone triggers some happiness in me. I feel like I'm helping my future "disabled" self. 

That's not a bad wish on me. Age/time has a way of bringing forth fewer abilities. And life may hit us at any time before death comes knocking.

I've changed the mood, right? Yes. Let's switch, cos we are amazing.

CSS can be tiresome. From naming things to What the hell is happening. Still, I love you just the way you are. 

Hey, JavaScript. While I'm happy to go down with you, I felt super happy knowing there's just a part of you specifically for the presentation. What an excuse for my poor little brain, right? 

I moove!

Yet, not far away from these core technologies. Meaning, I'll be sticking around  Nunjunks for HTML, PostCSS for CSS, and Svelte for sites & apps.

As you've seen, I'm pretty convinced I've figured out where I want to belong. What's left is how do I tell the world where I belong?

Web Master is definitely not it. Sounds too broad and archaic. Probably because of the word - Master. I wouldn't mind being nicked with Web Sensei though. I'm hope this isn't what Yorubas say with the proverb, _‚Äúeni t'aye se to'n lo ogun eje‚Äù_.

Web Developer isn't it for me as well, I love the word developer but I'm more design-centric. 

Web Designer sounds perfect, right? Yes, but then... In this modern world with Frontend end frameworks using JavaScript to do backend stuff that developers do, it calls for new roles. And they are Frontend Designers, and Frontend Developers.

Remember that I'm running with my tail, at my back, from core development to design? So Frontend Designer sound like it, _shey_?

It does. But before I settled on this, I realised there are similar terms: UI Developer, UI Engineer, Design Engineer. 

I once joked about being a Design Developer.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are:<br><br>‚Ä¢ UI Developers,<br>‚Ä¢ UX Developers<br><br>Since I&#39;d love to tinker with both UI &amp; UX, can I just call myself:<br><br>‚Ä¢ Design Developer ?<br><br>That sounds like some cool boss shit!</p>&mdash; 2 üëã (@ToheebDotCom) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToheebDotCom/status/1454038736099061765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Anyways, here's the final lap to decide. I'm ruling out UI Developer as "developer" taunts me. (Sorry. I promise, hands crossing my chest, I won't say "developer" again except in a new article).

As luck will have it, there's a name that has UI in it. Along with a word that depicts someone who codes. So, dear UI Engineer.

As it is, UI Engineer needs some clarification too. UI can be for native mobile apps or web apps. I'm for the latter. And "web" makes the distinction.

Hence, 

> Call me a Web-UI Engineer.

That's all?

_Nahhh!_ Curiosity makes me evolve while making stuff.

PS: I summarised all these into 140 characters for my About-Me. You can see this on [my website](toheeb.com).
